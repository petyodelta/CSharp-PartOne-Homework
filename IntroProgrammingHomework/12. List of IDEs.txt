Microsoft Visual Studio
This IDE is mostly used by corporate programmers to produce .NET code.I has automatic code formatting.

Eclipse
Very good alternative if you are not a big fan of Microsoft’s Visual Studio.You can use use languages such as Ruby, C, C++ and many many more.This IDE is free.

Netbeans
The is the number one alternative to Eclipse. This program is extensible and free, and it compiles code which is a bonus.I is also free like Eclipse.
